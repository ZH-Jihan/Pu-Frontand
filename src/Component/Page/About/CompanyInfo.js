              BRIEF PU INTRODUCTION <br></br>The quality and relevance of education
              the young generation in Bangladesh receives is of great importance
              to our countryâ€™s development. The nation, therefore, has a great
              stake in how our universities are educating and training the
              students. Soon after the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971, the
              public universities were stretched to their limits in
              accommodating the growing number of students seeking higher
              education. To prevent the outflow of talented students to foreign
              universities, the government of Bangladesh enacted the Private
              University Act 1992 which increased the educational opportunities
              within the country. The Presidency University Foundation, a
              dynamic group of 30 teachers, leaders of business and industry,
              and retired government officers, came together and petitioned the
              government for a permit to establish and operate Presidency
              University. On July 21, 2003, the Ministry of Education (MoE) of
              the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), in keeping with the Private
              University Act 1992, authorized the establishment and operation of
              Presidency University. Thereafter, Presidency University opened
              its door to students in September of 2003. SPONSORSHIP The
              Principal Sponsor of Presidency University is Mr. Muslehuddin
              Ahmad, a former Secretary and Ambassador of Bangladesh, who was
              also the sponsor and Founder President (VC) of North South
              University. Indeed it is he who first came out with the proposal
              to establish a private university in Bangladesh in 1988. On the
              basis of an article, The Private University in Bangladesh, an
              initial proposal, by Junaid K. Ahmad, which was published first on
              February 2, 1988 in Bidesh Bangla, a magazine published in
              California, USA. With his direct experience of over a decade to
              establish and run a private university, Mr. Muslehuddin Ahmad was
              aware of the opportunities and the difficulties. It was his
              mission to set up another university that can really be a center
              of Excellence and be the Model for others and hence the
              justification for another private university - Presidency
              University. MISSION AND VALUES Presidency University has been
              established with the aim of providing quality education to its
              students at the lowest possible expense. The emphasis is given to
              creating an institution dedicated to excellence in teaching,
              research, training and community services. One of the main
              objectives is to develop human resources capable of understanding
              and facing the socio-economic need of the country. The university
              shall also do everything possible to protect and promote
              Bangladeshi cultural heritage. The university aims to fully equip
              each student with the necessary skills to be active participants
              in the information age. Special emphasis is given to hands-on
              experience, computer and other IT skills development and research
              techniques. The university emphasizes critical thinking,
              problem-solving skills, and communication skills in its teaching
              methods and classroom practices. Presidency University is
              committed to the principle of equal opportunity and it ensures
              that all students and employees of the university regardless of
              race, sex, religion, nationality, origin, social grouping, and age
              receive the benefits of a just and equitable system.
